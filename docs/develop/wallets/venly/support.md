What makes Venly (prev. Arkane) stand out is their commitment to supporting the ecosystem. Not only their wallet users, by explaining what gas is, or by helping them import an Ethereum wallet into Polygon. But also the developers that are using Venly to build new upcoming products.

Even in their test environments, they add an in-app chat so that developers can directly communicate with the team behind the Venly platform. In case you want to learn more, check out their [detailed product documentation](https://docs.venly.io/widget/).
